The Odin Project - Learning Journey
Welcome to my repository for The Odin Project curriculum! This repository contains my completed projects, exercises, and notes as I progress through the course. My goal is to build a solid foundation in web development by learning full-stack skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and more.

Overview
This repository serves as my journey log through The Odin Project. Each project folder includes the files for specific exercises or projects, as well as notes on concepts learned.

Projects
Below are some of the projects I am working on as part of the curriculum. This list will expand as I progress through the course:

HTML/CSS Foundations

A series of exercises to build a solid understanding of HTML structure and styling with CSS.
Projects: Webpage layouts, responsive design, Flexbox, Grid
JavaScript Basics

Basic JavaScript exercises for understanding syntax, functions, and DOM manipulation.
Projects: Calculator app, Rock-Paper-Scissors game
Intermediate JavaScript

Diving deeper into JavaScript, working with arrays, objects, and more complex functions.
Projects: Etch-a-Sketch, To-Do List app
Front-End Frameworks and Libraries

Learning to use tools like React for building interactive UIs.
Projects: React-based apps to practice state and component-based development
Technologies and Skills
This repository will reflect my progress with the following skills:

HTML/CSS: Semantic HTML, Flexbox, Grid, responsive design
JavaScript: Basic syntax, functions, DOM manipulation, and ES6+ features
Git and GitHub: Version control, branching, and collaboration
React (Coming soon): Components, props, state, and React Router
Node.js and Express (Coming soon): Backend development
Getting Started
To explore my projects:

Navigate to a specific project: Each project folder will have a README with setup instructions if needed.
Open in your browser: Most HTML/CSS/JS projects can be opened directly in a web browser to see them in action.

Future Plans
As I progress through the curriculum, Iâ€™ll be working on more complex projects and learning new technologies, including:

Full-Stack Development: Adding back-end skills with Node.js and Express.
Deployment: Hosting projects on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
Collaboration: Contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers.
